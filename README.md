# Astar 15 Puzzle Solver
<br>
This project implements the A* algorithm to solve the classic 15 puzzle. The 15 puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The objective is to move the tiles to their correct position by sliding them around the empty space.
<br>
The A* algorithm is used to find the shortest possible path from the initial state of the puzzle to its goal state. The algorithm uses a combination of a heuristic function and a cost function to guide the search towards the goal state in an efficient manner.
<br>
The project is written in Python and the implementation of the A* algorithm can be easily extended to other similar puzzle solving problems.
