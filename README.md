# Astar 15 Puzzle Solver

This project implements the A* algorithm to solve the classic 15 puzzle.

The 15 puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a frame of numbered square tiles in random order with one tile missing. The objective is to move the tiles to their correct position by sliding them around the empty space.

The A* algorithm is used to find the shortest possible path from the initial state of the puzzle to its goal state. The algorithm uses a combination of a heuristic function and a cost function to guide the search towards the goal state in an efficient manner.

The project is written in Python and the implementation of the A* algorithm can be easily extended to other similar puzzle solving problems.
